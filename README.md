//a program that will register runners for the race and give them instructions on race day. 
Start time:
/* -Adult registrants run at 9:30 am or 11:00 am.
-Early adults run at 9:30 am.
-Late adults run at 11:00 am.
-Youth registrants run at 12:30 pm (regardless of registration).
...But we didnâ€™t plan for runners that are exactly 18!... */
